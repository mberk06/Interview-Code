# Interview-Code
These are files developed in a professional setting. I have also developed a variety of SQL queries and SKlearn scripts that could not be committed due to IP.

**SankeyDiagramSample**
- Summer 2019
- Sankey diagram that takes a pandas data frame and outputs a plotly Sankey diagram figure. Non-technical users can customize the graph to gain actionable insights into user behavior.

**SchorkAutomationGithub.py**
- Summer 2018
- Automation script for my summer internship with the Schork Group. This file populates their daily newsletter (but does not function without the template or username/password).
